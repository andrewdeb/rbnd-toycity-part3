1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Around 10 hours

2.What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Adding the brand functionality to the code.

3.What 2 additional features did you build? Why?
3.1 Brand has been added as one of the variables in the Product class. It is always important to track brand sales in the retail environment.
3.2 Time of purchase has been added in the Transaction code. It is an important auditing feature to be able to track the time of purchase - there may be queries from customers later and the exact date and time will be useful.

4.Where do you still have room to grow?
I still need to learn a lot about OOP and inheritance of properties.
